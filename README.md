# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-Fundus-Images-By-CNN-Model
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, leading to vision 
impairment and blindness if left untreated. Diabetic Retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in 
the working age population of the developed world. World health organisation estimates that 347 million 
people have this disease worldwide. Early detection of DR is crucial for timely intervention and 
preventing irreversible damage. In this study, we propose a robust approach for diabetic retinopathy 
detection leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Residual Networks (ResNet) with 
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions. Our methodology involves the utilization of a deep 
learning framework to analyze retinal images and accurately classify the severity of diabetic retinopathy. 
The CNN architecture serves as the foundation, extracting hierarchical features from the input images, 
The integration of ResNet architecture further facilitates the training of deeper networks, addressing the 
challenges of vanishing gradients and accelerating convergence. The choice of ReLU activation 
functions enhances the network's non-linearity, enabling more effective modeling of complex 
relationships within the data.
